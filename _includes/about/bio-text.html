            Ian is a classically trained cello and piano player with a reputation for pushing the boundaries by experimenting with these, as well as other rare and exotic instruments. Not only is he known for using his cello for melodic phrases throughout his scores, but also unique, intricate percussive and atmospheric elements.
            <br/><br/> 
            Ian began studying cello at five years old and then the piano at ten. He was eventually presented with the highest award for both instruments in his teens. Music quickly became an integral part of his life. At the age of 14, Ian took up the bass guitar, followed by electric and acoustic guitar, while performing in orchestras and producing music for rock and jazz bands. It was at this stage that Ian began to experiment with composition and discovered his true passion. Deciding to focus all his efforts on this, Ian subsequently studied music composition and production at the University of Kent, in England.
